# 📊 Project 1 - Predicting Active Users on a Website

Welcome to my personal data science project! This project is part of my journey to become a data scientist, leveraging my knowledge in time series analysis. The goal is to predict the number of active users on a website using various techniques and models.

## 🌟 Project Overview
Time series analysis involves examining datasets that change over time to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations. It is widely used in fields like finance, economics, and meteorology to forecast future values based on past data.

## 🔍 Steps Involved in Time Series Analysis

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Gather relevant data over a specified period.
   - Ensure the data is accurate and timely for meaningful analysis.

2. **Visualisation**: 
   - Visualise the data using plots and graphs.
   - Understand underlying patterns, trends, and seasonal variations.

3. **Decomposition**: 
   - Decompose the time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual (noise).
   - Understand the individual elements affecting the data.

4. **Stationarity**: 
   - Ensure the data is stationary (statistical properties like mean and variance do not change over time).
   - Use techniques such as differencing or transformation to achieve stationarity if needed.

5. **Model Selection**: 
   - Apply various models to the time series data, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), and EMA (Exponential Moving Average).
   - Choose the model based on the characteristics of the data and specific analysis requirements.

6. **Parameter Estimation and Validation**: 
   - Estimate and validate the model's parameters.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model performs well on unseen data.

7. **Forecasting**: 
   - Predict future values of the time series using the validated model.
   - Make informed decisions based on the forecasts.

8. **Evaluation and Updating**: 
   - Evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
   - Update or refine the model to improve forecasting accuracy if needed.

## 🚀 Getting Started
In this project, all these steps will be carried out to predict active users on a website. Stay tuned for updates and results!

Happy analysing! 🎉
